## Core Algorithms



### Dynamic Resource Allocation

The framework implements a priority-based resource allocation algorithm that:

- Groups clients by their assigned slices.
- For each base station and slice, applies slice-specific allocation strategies.
- Prioritizes clients based on waiting time, QoS class, and slice type.
- Ensures minimum guaranteed bandwidth before distributing remaining resources.


def dynamic_resource_allocation(env, slices, clients):
    while True:
         Group clients by slice
        clients_by_slice = {}
        for client in clients:
            if client.base_station is None or not client.connected:
                continue
                
            slice_obj = client.get_slice()
            if slice_obj:
                slice_name = slice_obj.name
                if slice_name not in clients_by_slice:
                    clients_by_slice[slice_name] = []
                clients_by_slice[slice_name].append(client)
        
        # Apply dynamic allocation for each slice
        for base_station in base_stations:
            for slice_obj in base_station.slices:
                if hasattr(slice_obj, 'dynamic_resource_allocation'):
                    slice_clients = clients_by_slice.get(slice_obj.name, [])
                    bs_clients = [c for c in slice_clients if c.base_station == base_station]
                    if bs_clients:
                        slice_obj.dynamic_resource_allocation(bs_clients)
        
        yield env.timeout(0.5)


### Intelligent Base Station Selection

The framework uses a load-aware base station selection algorithm that considers both distance and current load:

def assign_closest_base_station(self, exclude=None):
    updated_list = []
    for d, b in self.closest_base_stations:
        if exclude is not None and b.pk in exclude:
            continue
        d = distance((self.x, self.y), (b.coverage.center[0], b.coverage.center[1]))
        
        # Calculate load as percentage of capacity used
        slice_load = 0
        if hasattr(b, 'slices') and len(b.slices) > self.subscribed_slice_index:
            target_slice = b.slices[self.subscribed_slice_index]
            if hasattr(target_slice, 'capacity') and hasattr(target_slice.capacity, 'level'):
                slice_load = 1 - (target_slice.capacity.level / target_slice.capacity.capacity)
        
        # Weighted score: distance + load factor
        score = d * (1 + slice_load)
        updated_list.append((score, d, b))
        
    # Sort by the combined score
    updated_list.sort(key=operator.itemgetter(0))
    
    for score, d, b in updated_list:
        if d <= b.coverage.radius:
            self.base_station = b
            return


### Adaptive Resource Reservation
The framework dynamically adjusts reserved capacity based on recent latency trends:

def _adapt_reserved_capacity(self):
    if not self.latency_history or len(self.latency_history) < 5:
        return
        
    # Get recent trend
    recent = self.latency_history[-5:]
    recent_avg = sum(recent) / len(recent)
    
    # If recent latency is higher than overall average, increase reservation
    if recent_avg > self.avg_latency and recent_avg > (0.8 * self.delay_tolerance):
        new_reserve = min(self.init_capacity * 0.1, 
                          self.reserved_capacity + (self.init_capacity * 0.02))
        self.reserved_capacity = new_reserve
    # If recent latency is lower, we can reduce reservation
    elif recent_avg < self.avg_latency and recent_avg < (0.5 * self.delay_tolerance):
        self.reserved_capacity = max(0, 
                                   self.reserved_capacity - (self.init_capacity * 0.01))


                                   

### Parameter Sweep
The parameter sweep algorithm tests various configurations to identify the optimal resource allocation for each slice. The main goal is to evaluate how different settings for resource_reservation and bandwidth_guaranteed affect performance metrics like latency, throughput, and SLA violations.


def generate_test_configs(base_config):
    """Generate test configurations for parameter sweep"""
    param_space = {
        'urllc': {'resource_reservation': [0.1, 0.2, 0.3], 'bandwidth_guaranteed': [2, 5, 10]},
        'iot': {'resource_reservation': [0.05, 0.1, 0.15], 'bandwidth_guaranteed': [5, 10, 15]},
        'data': {'resource_reservation': [0.0, 0.05, 0.1], 'bandwidth_guaranteed': [500, 1000, 1500]}
    }
Parameter Space: Defines the potential values for resource_reservation and bandwidth_guaranteed for each slice type (URLLC, IoT, Data).

    for slice_name, params in param_space.items():
        for param_name, values in params.items():
            for value in values:
                test_config = copy.deepcopy(base_config)
                test_config['slices'][slice_name][param_name] = value
                test_config['settings']['simulation_time'] = 20
                config_name = f"{slice_name}{param_name}{str(value).replace('.', '_')}"
                configs.append((config_name, test_config))
                config_info.append({'slice_name': slice_name, 'param_name': param_name, 'param_value': value})
    return configs, config_info

Configuration Generation: Iterates over the parameter combinations, modifies the base configuration for each, and stores the resulting configurations.

Purpose:
The parameter sweep enables the framework to explore different configurations and identify the most optimal setup for each slice, improving performance metrics such as latency, throughput, and SLA violations. By running simulations with various combinations, the system can find the ideal balance of resource reservation and bandwidth guarantees for each slice type.

## Acknowledgments
This framework was developed as a research project for 5G network optimization. Special thanks to all contributors who helped design, implement, and test this system.

This project was developed as an advanced optimization framework inspired by the foundational simulation environment provided by Rohan Chandrashekar's 5G Network Slicing Simulation project.

A special thanks to that work, which provided a robust and modular starting point for implementing and testing the new optimization algorithms and adaptive strategies found in this framework.

Key Differences and Optimizations
While the base simulation project provides an excellent environment for simulating network slices, this Optimization Framework introduces several new, automated features focused on finding and applying the most efficient resource allocation strategies.

Here are the primary additions:

Automated Parameter Sweep: This framework includes a complete workflow (optimize_slices.py) that automatically runs dozens of simulations, testing different combinations of resource_reservation and bandwidth_guaranteed to find the optimal configuration.

Intelligent Base Station Selection: The client connection logic was upgraded from a simple "closest base station" model to a load-aware algorithm. It now calculates a weighted score based on both distance and the current resource load of the target slice on a base station, preventing congestion.

Adaptive Resource Reservation: A new _adapt_reserved_capacity algorithm was implemented. This allows slices (especially URLLC) to dynamically increase or decrease their reserved capacity in real-time based on recent latency trends, ensuring QoS is met without over-provisioning resources.

Focus on Measurable Results: The project is built around an analyze_optimization_results.py script that directly compares the "Base Configuration" against the "Optimized Configuration" to produce a clear results table, proving the effectiveness of the optimization.

Comprehensive Visualization: The framework generates a complete dashboard that not only shows real-time metrics but also includes charts specifically designed to visualize the impact of parameters on performance, allowing for deeper analysis.
